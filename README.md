# British-Airways-Flight-Booking-Predictions
This project aims to predict the likelihood of flight bookings using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical booking data, user behavior, and flight details, the model identifies key factors influencing ticket purchases.

## Introduction
Understanding booking behaviors in the aviation industry can drive strategic pricing, resource allocation, and customer satisfaction. I recently worked on a Flight Booking Prediction project for British Airways to predict whether a user would complete a flight booking based on their interactions. Hereâ€™s how I approached it:

## Situation
Many users searched for flights but abandoned the booking process as they struggled with low conversion rates. The goal was to predict whether a customer would complete a flight booking based on historical data, allowing for targeted marketing and improved user experience.

## Task
My objective was to build a machine learning model that could analyze user behavior, identify key factors influencing booking decisions, and predict conversion likelihood with high accuracy.

## Action
âœ… I collected and cleaned a dataset containing user interactions, flight details, pricing, and session duration.

âœ… I Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in user behavior.

âœ… Engineered relevant features such as time spent on the site, number of searches, and price sensitivity.

âœ… Applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, selecting the best-performing model based on accuracy and F1-score.

âœ… Optimized the model using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

## Result
ðŸš€ The best-performing model achieved 91% accuracy in predicting whether a user would book a flight.

ðŸ“ˆ Insights from feature importance analysis helped refine the companyâ€™s marketing strategies, leading to a 10% increase in conversion rates through personalized promotions and retargeting campaigns.

This project shows the power of data-driven decision-making in the travel industry. By predicting customer behavior, businesses can enhance user experience, improve revenue, and reduce churn.
